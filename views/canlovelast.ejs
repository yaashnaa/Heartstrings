<div class="heading-1">Can Love Last? The Fate of Romance Over Time</div>
<div class="article-content">Written by psychoanalyst Steven Mitchell, explores the challenges that
couples face as their relationships evolve over time. One of the key themes of the book is the role of fantasy and
imagination in sustaining love and romance. In this article, we will delve into the insights from the book and the
importance of fantasy and imagination in relationships.</div>

<div class="subheading-2">The Role of Fantasy and Imagination</div>

<div class="article-content">According to Mitchell, fantasy and imagination are essential ingredients in sustaining a romantic relationship. In the
early stages of a relationship, couples are often consumed with passion and infatuation. However, as the relationship
evolves, these intense feelings often give way to routine and predictability. Mitchell argues that couples need to
actively cultivate their imagination and fantasy to keep the romance alive.</div>

<div class="article-content">Mitchell believes that fantasy and imagination can take many forms in a relationship. It can be as simple as daydreaming
about your partner or as elaborate as creating a shared fantasy world. These imaginative spaces allow couples to explore
different aspects of themselves and their relationship that may not be possible in the real world. They also provide a
sense of novelty and excitement that can help break up the monotony of daily life.</div>

<div class="subheading-2">Why Fantasy and Imagination are Important</div>

<div class="article-content">Fantasy and imagination are important because they allow couples to connect on a deeper level. Mitchell argues that
through shared fantasies, couples can explore different aspects of their personalities and emotions, and gain a deeper
understanding of each other. These imaginative spaces also allow for exploration and experimentation, which can be
difficult to achieve in the real world.</div>

<div class="article-content">Fantasy and imagination can also help couples navigate the challenges of long-term relationships. Mitchell argues that
as couples spend more time together, they inevitably become more comfortable with each other, which can lead to a lack
of excitement and passion. However, by actively cultivating their imagination and fantasy life, couples can keep the
romance alive and continue to explore new aspects of themselves and their relationship.</div>



<div class="article-content">In conclusion, the role of fantasy and imagination is essential in sustaining love and romance over time. Steven
Mitchell's book, Can Love Last? The Fate of Romance Over Time, highlights the importance of cultivating one's
imagination and fantasy life to keep the passion and excitement alive in long-term relationships. By exploring different
aspects of themselves and their relationship, couples can deepen their connection and continue to grow together over
time.</div>
